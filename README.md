## Hands-On Activities
This course includes three lab exercises focused on key machine learning techniques:

1. **Linear Regression** – You'll build a model to predict medical costs using factors like age, gender, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.
2. **Logistic Regression** – You'll train a model to recognize and classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
3. **K-Means Clustering** – You'll use clustering to compress an image, reducing its file size while keeping most of its visual quality.

These lab exercises make use of [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/), an open-source data visualization, machine learning and data mining toolkit.

For the **final project**, you'll explore a range of AI models, from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), applied to computer vision tasks. These include **Depth Estimation, Image Classification, Object Detection, Text-to-Image generation, and Text-to-Video generation**.
